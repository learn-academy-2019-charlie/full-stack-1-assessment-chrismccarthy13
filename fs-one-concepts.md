Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online. Once you're done writing your first answer, you can google the question and write the best answer you find.

#### 1. What is Enzyme and what are some of the methods that it provides?
Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output. 
You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.

#### 2. What is the difference between dynamic and a static routes?
Static Routing is also known as non-adaptive routing which doesn’t change routing table unless the network administrator changes or modify them manually.
Dynamic routing is also known as adaptive routing which change routing table according to the change in topology.

#### 3. What is a JSON API?
JSON stands for JavaScript object notation and is used to interchange data.

#### 4. What is a migration and why would you use one?
Migrations are a way of defining the schema of your database.
They are used for adding, dropping, modifying database columns and tables.

#### 5. Explain how to set up a route in React.
You first need to install and add react-router-dom to the main app file.
You then will need to set up your router path.

#### 6. When would you use a generate resource over a generate controller?
You generate a resource when you a creating a controller that will handle data. 
If you want to be able to create, read, update, or delete infomration from that database, then you would generate a resource so that you can create the necessary methods more easily for the purposes of those HTTP verbs.

#### 7. Explain the difference between a controller spec and a request spec.
A controller spec is an RSpec wrapper for a Rails functional test and it allows you to simulate a single http request.
Request specs provide a thin wrapper around Rails' integration tests, and are designed to drive behavior through the full stack.

#### 8. Describe the React component lifecycle. What are some of the lifecycle methods?
Every React Component has a lifecycle of its own, lifecycle of a component can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component’s existence.
A React Component can go through four stages of its life initialization, mounting, updating and unmounting.

#### 9. At this point in the program, what technologies/languages do you find yourself gravitating to?
I definitely enjoy the front end side of programming and using react more than the backend.
I like the creativity and design aspects involved in front end programming.
